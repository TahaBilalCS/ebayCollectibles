# ebayCollectibles

Contains lots of useful information on a list of vintage items that I am interested in collecting one day. 
I would like to come back to this project eventually and hook up a front end framework to it to better manage this information.

Analyzes vintage items and tracks their prices locally using eBay’s RESTful API. Provides access to all item statistics that can be retrieved at anytime without having to reissue more API requests through the usage of pickle files in Python.

•	Local logging and storage system that helps track and avoid errors

•	Batched item requests that allow flexible keyword searches across 20+ servers
