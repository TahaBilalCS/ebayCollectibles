# ebayCollectibles


Analyzes vintage items and tracks their prices locally using eBay’s RESTful API. Provides easy access to all item statistics that can be retrieved at anytime without having to reissue more API requests. 

•	Local logging and storage system that helps track and avoid errors

•	Batched item requests that allow flexible keyword searches across 20+ servers

An uncompleted project of mine started earlier this year. Contains lots of useful information on a list of vintage items that I am interested in collecting one day. 
Will come back to this project when the time is right and plan on having it accessible for everyone to use.
